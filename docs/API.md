# FITZY API reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/api`. JSON responses use `{ "success": true, "data": ... }`; errors use `{ "success": false, "error": { "code", "message" } }`. Lists include `data.items` and `data.pagination` where applicable.

## Authentication and access

Public registration always creates `customer`. The API never exposes a public admin registration route. Obtain a token from login/register and send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Blocked accounts cannot authenticate or use protected routes. Admin paths also require `role=admin`; the owner of a customer resource is checked on orders, reviews, and favorites.

## Place an order

The client sends product and variant IDs plus quantity. It does not send prices, discount amount, shipping fee, or total. The server loads active product and variant records, validates stock and the promotion, calculates totals, reserves inventory, and writes the order in one transaction.

```json
{
  "items": [{ "productId": "<mongo-id>", "variantId": "<variant-id>", "quantity": 1 }],
  "promotionCode": "FITZY10",
  "paymentMethod": "cod",
  "shipping": {
    "recipient": "Nguyen An",
    "phone": "0912345678",
    "line1": "12 Nguyen Hue",
    "ward": "Ben Nghe",
    "district": "District 1",
    "city": "Ho Chi Minh City"
  }
}
```

Valid status flow: `pending → confirmed → shipping → completed`; `pending` and `confirmed` can transition to `cancelled`. A cancellation restores inventory and frees one promotion use in the same transaction. A paid bank-transfer order must be refunded by an admin before cancellation. Checkout supports COD and manual bank transfer. Bank transfer appears only when `BANK_TRANSFER_BANK_NAME`, `BANK_TRANSFER_ACCOUNT_NAME`, and `BANK_TRANSFER_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` are configured on the API. The buyer transfers the order total using the order number as the transfer description; an admin verifies the bank statement and confirms receipt through `PATCH /orders/:id/payment/confirm`. COD is marked paid at completion. Revenue reports include only completed orders. Cards and e-wallets require a payment gateway integration and are not enabled.

## Validation and error cases

- `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, `400 INVALID_QUANTITY`, `400 SHIPPING_REQUIRED`, `400 PROMOTION_INVALID`
- `401 AUTH_REQUIRED`, `401 AUTH_EXPIRED`, `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS`
- `403 ADMIN_REQUIRED`, `403 ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, `403 REVIEW_NOT_ALLOWED`
- `404 NOT_FOUND`, `404 ORDER_NOT_FOUND`
- `409 EMAIL_IN_USE`, `409 INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`, `409 CANCEL_NOT_ALLOWED`, `409 INVALID_ORDER_TRANSITION`, `409 CATEGORY_IN_USE`
- Firebase exchange also returns `503 FIREBASE_NOT_CONFIGURED` when API Admin credentials are not configured, and `409 EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` before linking a Firebase account to an existing FITZY profile.
- Lists cap `limit` by resource. The server only returns published posts and active products/categories on public routes.

## Postman smoke sequence

1. `POST /auth/register` with a new customer and store `data.token`.
2. `GET /products?limit=12&sort=popular`, select a product and an available variant.
3. `POST /promotions/check` with `code` and `items` to preview the server-calculated discount.
4. `POST /orders` with the shipping payload above, then `GET /orders`.
5. Sign in at `/auth/login` with the seeded admin, replace the Bearer token, then call `/stats` and `/orders/admin/list`.
6. Attempt `/admin/products` with the customer token; it should return 403.
